# touchscreen_draw
Arduino and Processing sketch that allows user to draw on TFT screen and have results shown on computer screen using Processing.

### To Use

1) Load TFT_drew.ino onto Arduino. For this project I used the 2.8" TFT Touch Shield by Seeedstudio. 

2) Once loaded, you should be able to draw on the TFT shield. 

3) Start the TFT_draw.pde program using Processing. You may need to adjust the serial port specified in setup.
